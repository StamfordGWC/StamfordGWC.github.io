  <h1>About us</h1>
<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<p>Each Girls Who Code club aims to use technology to benefit the community. In reading and hearing the news about <a href="/DACA.html">DACA</a>, we recognized our own lack of knowledge about immigration issues and saw a need to get the word out to our peers. We would like to help our peers understand how immigration issues are likely to affect each of their lives. The hope is that this information is shared with their family and friends. Often, children of immigrant parents are the source of their parents' information.</p>
<h2>How It Might Help Others</h2>
<ul>
<li>Address what the current general understanding is of a non-documented person’s rights.</li>
<li>How best to protect yourself and your family.</li>
<li>Identify community resources.</li>
<li>Know your rights under the law.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who We Are</h2>

  <p>Sabrina Ahamed:</p>
<p>I am 17 years old. I go to Academy of Information Technology and Engineering (AITE). Over the summer of 2017, I was in a Girls Who Code (GWC) program and liked it so much that I decided to join an after school club. GWC has given me the chance to help people through the use of technology. I would like to use computer science to help change the world, even if it is in a small way.

  <p>Reina Torres Beltran:</p>
<p>Hi, I’m Reina and I’m 16 years old. I’m a rising senior at AITE. Recent changes in immigration policies have affected me personally, and I decided to become more involved and inform my community. The perfect way to inform my community ends up being using the skills that I developed through the Girls Who Code summer immersion program the summer of 2017.
