  <title>About Us</title>
<h1>Our Goal</h1>
<p>Each Girls Who Code club aims to use technology to benefit the community. We recognized in our own lack of knowledge a need for greater information relating to immigration issues.</p>
<h1>How It Might Help Others</h1>
<ul>
<li>Address what the current general understanding is of a non-documented person’s rights.</li>
<li>How best to protect yourself and your family.</li>
<li>Identify community resources.</li>
<li>Know your rights under the law.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Who We Are</h1>
<p>Sabrina Ahamed:
I am 17 years old. I go to Academy of Information Technology and Engineering. Over the summer, I was in a Girls Who Code program and liked it so much that I decided to join an after school club with Girls Who Code. Girls Who Code has given me the chance to help people through the use of technology.</p>

<p>Reina Torres Beltran:
Hi, I’m Reina and I’m 16 years old. I’m a junior at AITE. Recent changes in immigration policies that have affected me personally, I decided to become more involved and inform my community. The perfect way to inform my community ends up being using the skills that I developed through the Girls Who Code summer immersion program the summer of 2017.
