  <li>If they do have a warrant ask them to slip it under the door and make sure it is signed by a judge</li>
  <li>If the warrant is signed by a judge, the person they are seeking should go out another door and go to them so other family members are not affected</li>
  <li>ICE does not have the right to search your house without a warrant</li>
  <li>Don’t sign any documents without a lawyer</li>
  <li>When ICE asks you questions simply state that you do not wish to answer their questions</li>

<li>What to do if ICE approaches you on the street:</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
  <li>Stay calm. Don't run. </li>
  <li>Ask if you are under arrest:</li>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
      <li>If not: ask to leave. </li>
      <li>If you are not free to go, that means you are being detained.</li>
        <ol style="1">
          <li>They can pat you down, if they think you have a weapon.</li>
          <li>If they search more you can state, "I don't consent to a search."</li>
          <li>Get enough information about the officers who arrested you. Ex: name(s), badge(s)#, etc.</li>
        </ol>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman" start="3">
      <li>(After) the arrest: </li>
        <ol style="1">
          <li>Ask for a lawyer and state that you will not answer any of their questions, "I will remain silent".</li>
          <li>Don't sign anything(s) without YOUR ATTORNEY</li>
          <li>You can make a phone call to your family to keep them informed.</li>
          <li>Ask for a hearing by a judge + bond</li>
