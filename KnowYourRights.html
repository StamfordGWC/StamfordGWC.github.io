  <h1>Know Your Rights</h1>
 <p>Don’t open the door unless they have a signed warrant by a judge.</p>
<p>If they do have a warrant ask them to slip it under the door and make sure it is signed by a judge.</p>
<p>If the warrant is signed by a judge, the person they are seeking should go out another door and go to them so other family members are not affected.</p>
<p>ICE does not have the right to search your house without a warrant.</p>
 <p>Don’t sign any documents without a lawyer.</p>
<p>When ICE asks you questions simply state that you do not wish to answer their questions.</p>
