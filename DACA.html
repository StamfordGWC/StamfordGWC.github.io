<h1>Information for Recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals! </h1>
<h3>What is DACA?</h3>
<p>DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, is a plan that the Obama administration put in place, so that children brought into the US with undocumented parents could attain legal status. The children must meet several requirements and apply to be considered for the two-year defend action program. And once received the approval of being a DACA recipient, you are allowed to have a work permit and protection from deportation. Note: Those who are not DACA recipients, are not eligible to apply for these permit/protection.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Those who qualify and are granted DACA status are called Dreamers because the law that implemented DACA is called the Dream Act.</li>
<li>DACA recipients must apply every two-years to continue their guaranteed protection in the US. </li>
<h3>There are many concerns about the DACA program under the Trump Administration.</h3>
<p>As of April 23rd, anyone with expired DACA status can reapply for a two-year extension.</p>
