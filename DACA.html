<h1>Information for Recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals! </h1>
<h3>What is DACA?</h3>
<p>DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, is a plan that the Obama administration put in place, so that children brought into the US with undocumented parents could attain legal status.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The children must meet several requirements and apply to be considered for the two-year defend action program.</li>
<li>Once you have received the approval of being a DACA recipient, you are allowed to have a work permit and protection from deportation.</li>
<li style="color:red;">Note: Those who are not DACA recipients, are not eligible to apply for these permits/protections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those who qualify and are granted DACA status are called <strong>Dreamers</strong> because the law that implemented DACA is called <strong>The Dream Act</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>DACA recipients must apply every two-years to continue their guaranteed protection in the US. </li>
</ul>
<h3>There are many concerns about the DACA program under the Trump Administration.</h3>
<p>Below is a short video produced by the New York Times in September 2017 outlining the changes the Trump administration planned:</p>
